# Using Google Earth Engine for Classification of Land Use and Land Cover to Gain Insight on a Particular Region of Interest 🌬️
### About 🪞

This repository contains code implementation of the paper "[Using Google Earth Engine for Classification of Land Use and Land Cover to Gain Insight on a Particular Region of Interest](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p0YVHwsrCYGXpL26UvW9PkMp81LerD2MF_px0ZjUjGU/edit?usp=sharing)".
### Note 📓
The codebase currently only analyzes California as the region of interest.

### Dependencies ⛓️

The code is implemented and tested on Jupyter Notebook (requires Anaconda installation). The following packages are used:

- `ipykernel==6.25.0`
- `scikit-learn==1.3.0`
- `matplotlib==3.7.2`
- `ipython==8.15.0`
- `jupyter==1.0.0`
- `numpy==1.24.3`
- `pandas==2.0.3`

The code is tested on `Python 3.11.5`.

### How to Use the Code 💻

The dataset is available in `lulc-air-quality/dataset/california-eleven-month-mol-m2.zip` and the codebase can be found in `lulc-air-quality/codebase/lulc-air-quality.ipynb`.

If you would like to train a model within Jupyter Notebook, run all the cells by finding `Cell` and `Run All`.

Make sure to change the dataset path to where it is stored on your local machine.
